                            Wow... This project was probably one of the more stressful ones. The coordinators of this project admitted that the allotted time for this project was too short and a 3-man team was needed. I think the entire project over 3 assignments took around 50+ hours which was pretty bonkers. On the bright side, my project and time management skills improved I guess...

                            This was one of those assignments where if you do not organize, structure and manage your time properly, you'll probably be in big trouble. Even with structure, the process still feels a bit messy sometimes. That said, this assignment spans across a month and we are required to meet certain checkpoints to proceed. As a result, project and time management were crucial. At the end of the day, the strain we were subjected to was well worth it in terms of our determination to persevere and complete the task. Our team's ultimate grade was 96% on the entire task, which was extremely outstanding.

                            Most of my time in this project is spent designing the visualisation itself. I have to ask myself "How should it look?", "How impactful it is to the users?", "How should I make it more interactive?" and "How should I make the whole visualisation come together?". But yeah, I think it was a pretty good experience such that it tested my creativity and decision-making skills.

                            This project was quite similar to the previous visualisation project and it is the first project that introduced me to HTML5. I remembered I was struggling to embed the Vega-Lite visualisations into my webpage and how to get the position of everything correctly (it was really a pain). That said, this project was an eye-opener in terms of how web design is carried out. Here's the link to the visualisation: <a target='_block' href="https://klee0087.github.io/3179-repo/visualisation-project2/">GitHub</a>.

                            Overall, I enjoyed the whole learning process and solving different types of problems to construct a simple website like this. I am truly grateful that I decided to take on this project as it allows me to gain insight into what a user usually sees on a website.

                            Took the knowledge I learned in my first internship and applied it to my new portfolio project. It now takes less hassle to change and modify the contents of the page due to sanity.io acting as a Content Management Systen.
