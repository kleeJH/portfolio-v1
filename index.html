                <p>Hello! Welcome to my first ever attempt at creating a website. It might look rough around the edges but I'm still getting used to it. Anyway, the reason I started working on this project is to expand my knowledge on how websites are developed. I guess we can think of this project to satisfy my curiosity on front-end development. I went into this not knowing how it works, so I started doing some research and watched some crash courses on HTML, CSS and JS on Youtube. After all that, this is how it turned out.</p>
                <p>I'll try to treat this as a long-term project where I try to keep this website as up-to-date as possible based on my own progress. I'll also introduce some new features here and there to spice my website even more! Other than that, thank you for reading this and I hope you enjoy my first ever project.</p>
                <p>Here are some of the videos that got me started: <a target='_block' href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE">HTML</a>, <a target='_block' href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfoY53QXEnI">CSS</a> and <a target='_block' href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdI2bqOjy3c">JS</a>. Special props to <a target='_block' href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA">Traversy Media</a> for the spectacular videos!</p>

                <p>What strives me to be motivated is the personal character development taking place and the experiences along the way. As we learn and experience, we tend to view things in ways that are different from others which makes us uniquely special. That uniqueness is what develops our personality to solve various problems and challenges distinctively.</p>
                <p>As of 18/11/2021, my goal is to learn and experience what Computer Science has to offer. To explore different branches of Computer Science and different technologies which further enhances a specific field. To my future self, I hope you were able to achieve this awe-inspiring goal from this long journey of yours.</p>

                <p>As of 22/1/2021, I do think back about the journey it took for me to get this far. In terms of the design, it looks simplistic and appealing to me but I'm not quite sure what other people think about it. I tried to make it themed after something dark (because I hate staring at white screens) and I think I may have gone too overboard with the turquoise... Another thing I am seriously angry about is the CSS code... I mean it is so messy and I'm pretty sure there are some duplicated code lying around (I wonder if this problem happens to people). Other than that, there are still improvements needed in some areas and maybe might consider using services/packages that others have created for us. That is all~</p>
